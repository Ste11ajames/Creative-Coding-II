reflection:

What I created vs what ChatGPT created there is quite a gap in the detail provided. For my Bagel I made a simple eclipse within a a larger eclipse to create a circle with a hole in the middle.As for ChatGPT it made a much more detailed bagel with seeds and different color to give it a more realistic look. Overall this was a nice assignment to help ease back into things. I found the P5.js ChatGPT extremely helpful when working on this as I am a bit rusty on how to get the files set up and connected. I'm sure I messed some things up but overall I'm excited to have this class in person to get help and connect with other classmated on there struggles and techniques.
