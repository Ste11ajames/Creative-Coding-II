For this assignment I initially had a lot of trouble adding the first images I had from my image folder so instead i used multiple images within my bagel (the two circles an seeds). At first I was struggling with knowing when to put things into the draw funtion and when to put them into their own function but I think I sorta figured it out. trying my best over here hahaha. Overall I'm excited to get away from the bagel...
