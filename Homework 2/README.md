What chaptGPT created vs me was much more intricate. I could only mamage to get one shape to move
and when I tried adding another everything froze. ChatGPT has much more going on in its final look.
When I looked at the Js it created there were lots of things going on in there that I didn't know.
The real major thing I needed help with from ChatGPT was figuring out how to keep the moving shape within in 
the boundaries of my canvas and have it bounce off the walla. SO i t was nice to see how the ai did that
and get an explanation.
